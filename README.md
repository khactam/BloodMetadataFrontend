There are 2 folders in the project, one is frontend, one is backend. You need to serve them both before the app can work correctly.

### Build Setup for backend
``` bash

# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with debug log at localhost:3030
node index.js

```

### Build Setup for frontend

``` bash

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

You will be able to use the project under http://localhost:8080
